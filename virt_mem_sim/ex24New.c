/*
********Important Types, Data Structures and Variables************************ 
Structs
tlb: struct representing an entry in translation lookaside buffer 
virtAddress: struct representing the page offset within the page table and displacement within page

Storage
backing: pointer to memory mapped secondary storage
main_memory: array of signed chars simulating RAM

Tables
tlBuf: array of type tlb representing the translation lookaside buffer
tlbindex: index into tlBuf
pagetable: array of ints simulating the page table

Counters
numPageRefs: number of page table references
numPageFaults: counts number of page faults
numTLBRefs: number of TLB tries
numTLBHits: number of TLB references that resulted in a hit

Addresses 
logical_address: address read from disk, simulating an address reference 
virtualAddress: variable of type virtAddress. Parse of logical_address into page number and offset
physical_page: page frame number
physical_address: bytes from the 0th byte of RAM, i.e., the actual physical address 
logical_page: page table number
offset: displacement within page table/frame 

Output
Virtual address: logical_address, in Addresses, above
Physical address: physical_address in Addresses, above 
value: value stored in main_memory at physical_page displacement plus offset
